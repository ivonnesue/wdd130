        <h2> Ivonne A. Ramos</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone. My name name is Ivonne Ramos. I am from Panama, my husband is from the Philippines, and we are currently
        living in California. I guess that makes us an international family. </p>
        <p>I was born in the covenant, and I am very blessed and grateful that I grew up learning the gospel and principles of Jesus Christ.
        One of my favorites scriptures is Proverbs 3:5-6 "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
        In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."
         </p>
        <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design, and for now I am pursuing a BYU-I Certificate in Web and Computer Programming.
        My graphic design experience was focused on print media, I am now interested in UI/UX design. Though, there are many tools 
        that allow designers to design an app or a website without coding, I read that learning to how to code, is a useful skill.</p>
        <p>This semester I am hoping to learn a lot of fun stuff and get to know you all.</p>
